# üìò Tutorial: Opening a Notebook in VS Code

Follow these simple steps to open and work with a `.ipynb` (Jupyter/Ipython Notebook) file using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.

**Requirements:** Make sure you have VS Code installed.

## 1. Open VS Code
- Launch **Visual Studio Code**
- You should see the ‚ÄúWelcome‚Äù screen.

## 2. Install the Jupyter (ipynb) Extension
To work with `.ipynb` notebooks, you need the **Jupyter extension**.

1. Click on the **Extensions** icon on the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`).
2. In the search bar, type **"Jupyter"**.
3. Click **Install** on the official extension by **Microsoft**.
   - This will also automatically install the **Python** extension if needed.

## 3. Download the Notebook File
You‚Äôll need to download a **Notebook** file.

1. Click the link below to open a repository on GitHub containing various notebooks:
    - [:fontawesome-solid-file-code: **Notebooks**](https://github.com/mickaeltemporao/data-analysis-codespace/tree/main/notebooks)
2. Once the page opens, locate the **`01-getting-started.ipynb`** file.
3. Click on the file to open it, then look for the **Download** icon (usually a downward arrow).
4. Save the file to a folder you can easily access (for example, your **Documents** or **Downloads** folder).

## 4. Open the Notebook in VS Code
1. In VS Code, go to **File ‚Üí Open File...**
2. Navigate to the folder where you saved the `.ipynb` file.
3. Select the file and click **Open**.

VS Code will automatically open it in **Notebook View**, showing code cells and outputs just like in Jupyter Notebook.

## 5. (Optional) Set Up a Python Environment
If you see a message about selecting a **kernel**:

1. Click **‚ÄúSelect Kernel‚Äù** at the top-right of the notebook.
2. Choose an existing Python environment or create a new one.
3. Wait for the environment to load ‚Äî then you can start running cells!

## You‚Äôre Ready!
You can now:
- Edit and run code cells (`Shift + Enter`)
- Write notes in Markdown cells
- Save your work normally (`Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`)
