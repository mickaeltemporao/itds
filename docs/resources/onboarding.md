Before the second class meeting, please complete the following steps:

1. **Join the Chat**  
    - Connect via [:fontawesome-brands-whatsapp: **WhatsApp**](https://chat.whatsapp.com/DUug7AgVtx5EanHW8XvwGp).  
    - Send a short hello message in the General channel once youâ€™ve joined.  

2. **Install a Package Manager**:
    - This will make installing software easier.
        - **Windows**: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)  
        - **Mac**: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
        - **Linux**: You already have a package manager (e.g., `apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`).

3. **Create a typst account**  
    - Sign up on [**typst**](https://typst.app/).
    - Typst is a modern alternative to LaTeX for typesetting scientific documents.

    - Sign up on [:fontawesome-brands-github: **GitHub**](https://github.com/) 
    - Validate your account with the code received by email.
