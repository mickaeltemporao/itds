# :fontawesome-regular-paper-plane: Onboarding

Before the second class meeting, please complete the following steps:


1. **Install a Package Manager**:  
    - This will make installing software easier.
        - **Windows**: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)  
        - **Mac**: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)  
        - **Linux**: You already have a package manager (e.g., `apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`).  

2. **Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**  
    - Download and install it from [:fontawesome-solid-laptop-code: **Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
    - This will be our main editor for coding and document preparation.

3. **Create a GitHub account**  
    - Sign up on [:fontawesome-brands-github: **GitHub**](https://github.com/) 
    - Validate your account with the code received by email.  

4. **Create a typst account**  
    - Sign up on [**typst**](https://typst.app/).   
    - Typst is a modern alternative to LaTeX for typesetting scientific documents.  

5. **Join the Chat**  
    - Connect via [:fontawesome-brands-whatsapp: **WhatsApp**](https://chat.whatsapp.com/DUug7AgVtx5EanHW8XvwGp).  
    - Send a short hello message once youâ€™ve joined.  

ðŸ’¡ *Donâ€™t worry if some of these tools donâ€™t make sense yet, weâ€™ll go over them together in class. For now, just make sure everything is installed and set up.*  


Other resources will continue to be added throughout the course length. You should check the resource pages regularly!
