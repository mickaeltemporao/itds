# Concepts, Variables, & Code?

## Agenda
- [ ] Collaborative paper discussion 
- [ ] A toolbox for science: LLMs, Typst, VS Code, Git/GitHub, 
- [ ] Hack-time: Academic citations in typst & package manager
- [ ] For next time 

<!-- ## Notebook -->
<!-- - [:fontawesome-solid-file-code: Getting Started with Python](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mickaeltemporao/itds/blob/main/materials/01-getting-started.ipynb) -->

# Hack-time

## Citing?
- [ðŸ“š Academic Citations in typst](../resources/writing.md#academic-citations-in-typst)

## Installing a Package Manager
- This will make installing software much easier!
    - **Windows**: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)  
    - **Mac**: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)  
    - **Linux**: You already have a package manager (e.g., `apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`).  
- Can you install :fontawesome-solid-laptop-code: VS Code using your package manager ?
- Can you install :fontawesome-brands-python: Python using your package manager ?

### Can you upload the codebooks to GitHub?
- Make sure everyone joined the shared [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mickaeltemporao/paper-spsc-2026).
- Upload the some relevant codebooks or docs to our shared repository.
- Add a relevant commit message to describe your contribution.
- Push your changes to GitHub.
