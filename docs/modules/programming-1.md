- Find the sources for CSES, ESS, and EES add them to bib, and cite where relevant
- Find and add links to download the most recent dataset for CSES, ESS, EES (create a Resources section)
- Find and add links to download the codebooks for the most recent datasets.
- Find/extract variables names to tackle the hypotheses
- EXTRA: Find other recent datasets?
