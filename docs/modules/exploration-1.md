### Link to demo notebooks
- [How to subset DataFrames](https://github.com/mickaeltemporao/itds/tree/main/materials/subset_dataframes.ipynb)



## Hack-time
!!! tip inline end
    To load and use a notebook in VS Code follow the steps 3 to 5 in [📘 Notebooks in VS Code](../resources/notebook-vscode.md)
### Working with Data

- The coding quest continues. Open the notebook of the day in VS Code:

## For next time

For everyone!
Remember 
    - you can ask me for help on WH
    - you can all work on each of these task together
    - 1 groups presents each section
    - Don't wait until you're the hackers to write code 


**:fontawesome-solid-pen-nib: Writers**

Don't talk about structure or what you did. We want to discuss the paper. What is it about, what are the current
problemts how we are going to fix them.

- Integrate scientific-paper-starter
- Add title, abstract, and add context before state of the art.
- Fix all citations!!!

**:fontawesome-solid-laptop-code: Hackers**

- Building up on previous week's notebook, 
- include SES variables
- Produce summaries of quantities of interest (QOI) using
    - value_counts, 
    - mean, ... methods
    You should take inspiration from previous existing papers.
- How to create basic visualisation using pandas/matplotlib (more advanced later)

**:fontawesome-solid-magnifying-glass: Reviewers**

- Prep a 5 minute current paper presentation (main file).

<!-- * **Bridge to data:** -->
<!--   Add a short *"From theory to measurement"* paragraph explaining **how the concepts in the literature translate into variables** the Hackers are identifying (e.g., like/dislike items -> affective distance). -->
