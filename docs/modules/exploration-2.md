## Hack-time
!!! tip inline end
    To load and use a notebook in VS Code follow the steps 3 to 5 in [📘 Notebooks in VS Code](../resources/notebook-vscode.md)

### Working with Data

- Open the notebook of the day in VS Code:
    - [:fontawesome-solid-folder: **Notebook Repository**](https://github.com/mickaeltemporao/materials/tree/main/notebooks)
        - [:fontawesome-solid-file-code: **Subsetting DataFrames** (student's notebok)](https://github.com/mickaeltemporao/materials/tree/main/notebooks/students/2025-2026/subset_dataframes.ipynb)


## For next time [WIP]

### **:fontawesome-solid-pen-nib: Writers**

<!-- Add a short *"From theory to measurement"* paragraph explaining **how the concepts in the literature translate into variables** the Hackers are identifying (e.g., like/dislike items). -->

Draft an initial paragraph about descriptive statistics summarising key findings from the Hackers' summary statistics.

### **:fontawesome-solid-laptop-code: Hackers**

Expand the notebook to produce visualisations and tables that illustrate patterns of affective polarisation and prepare them for inclusion in the paper.

### **:fontawesome-solid-magnifying-glass: Reviewers**

Check alignment between the introduction and the code sections, identifying inconsistencies, unclear interpretations, or missing connections.
