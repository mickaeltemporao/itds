# What's Next in the Spring Semester 

## Integrating Insights from the [Retrospective](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJoHVAtE=/)
We are streamlining the course to a single role: **:fontawesome-solid-laptop-code: Hackers**.

- Every week, we will run dedicated in-class coding sessions.
- Every other week, you will apply the previous week's code to advance the class project (during class).
- The goal is to help you translating hypotheses into executable code and increase your technical autonomy.

## What about the Paper?
For now, will focus on testing the **Main hypothesis:** 

- *Centrist Individuals exhibit lower levels of affective polarization.*

We will update the paper as we make progress but there is enough material already to fleshout a full paper.

## Where will we sync the code/paper?
A Github repository was created during the Fall. We will consolidate our code there as we make progress.

- **TODO:** Update groups, and add Group 1 & 2 [folders.](folders..md)

## Let's dive in!
- Notebook 3/4? - Modules & Packages
