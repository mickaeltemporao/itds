# Hack-time

## Installing a Package Manager
- This will make installing software much easier!
    - **Windows**: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)  
    - **Mac**: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)  
    - **Linux**: You already have a package manager (e.g., `apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`).  
- Can you install :fontawesome-solid-laptop-code: VS Code using your package manager ?
- Can you install :fontawesome-brands-python: Python using your package manager ?


<!-- - Make sure everyone joined the shared [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mickaeltemporao/paper-spsc-2026). -->
<!-- - Upload the some relevant codebooks or docs to our shared repository. -->
<!-- - Add a relevant commit message to describe your contribution. -->
<!-- - Push your changes to GitHub. -->

## For next time

**:fontawesome-solid-magnifying-glass: Reviewers**

- Suggest a tentative title for the paper.

**:fontawesome-solid-pen-nib: Writers**

- Write a 2-3 clean introductory paragraph (more details on [`main.typ`](https://typst.app/project/pItoK1GB7GRHDp8jniBMuD))
* Briefly state what affective polarization (AP) is and how it compares to ideological polarisation.
* Justify why France is an interesting case.
    * Discuss how electoral systems and multiparty competition can influence AP?
* End the section with clear hypotheses.

**:fontawesome-solid-laptop-code: Hackers**

- Create a conceptual model (DAG) of the paper (you can use [Miro](https://miro.com) or any other mind map tool.)
    - Work closely together with the Writers & Reviewers for this. Their progress will guide your progress. You need to engage in discussions all together.

!!! warning
    Don't forget to keep leveraging relevant references from the `references.bib` file.
