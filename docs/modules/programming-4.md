## Hack-time
!!! tip inline end
    To load and use a notebook in VS Code follow the steps 3 to 5 in [📘 Notebooks in VS Code](../resources/notebook-vscode.md)
### Working with Data

- Let's load Notebook \#01 into VS Code: 
    - [:fontawesome-solid-folder: **Notebook Repository**](https://github.com/mickaeltemporao/materials/tree/main/notebooks)


## For next time

**:fontawesome-solid-pen-nib: Writers**

- Work **collaboratively on the `main.typ` file** (other groups can also help, avoid silos).
- **Consolidate** everything written so far into an **initial "State of the Art"** section in the `main.typ` file.

    - Ensure smooth transitions between subsections and consistent referencing/style.
    - Integrate any missing literature.
    - You can keep previous existing files to help you draft, **but your presentation should focus on the updated `main.typ`**.

- **Deliverable:**

    - Updated `main.typ` and compiled pdf shared into the General Chat with the group.
    - A **5-minute overall presentation** walking through the current version of the paper in the `main.typ` file.

- Going the extra mile (Optional):
    - Integrate the previously created conceptual map of AP in multiparty systems (DAG).

**:fontawesome-solid-laptop-code: Hackers**

- **Identify and extract** the useful variables from the **ESS Round 10**, building on the **previously shared Jupyter Notebook**:

    - Country variable
    - Vote intention
    - Like/dislike variables toward parties or political actors

- **Deliverable:**

    - A **documented Notebook (`.ipynb`)** that builds on the previous notebook and uses **python comments to guide the user**.
        - It loads the ESS 10 data
        - Creates a list of strings with the identified variable names
        - Use this list to make a subset data frame with relevant variables only
        - You share the `.ipynb` file in the General Chat with the group
    - **5-minute demo** showing variable selection and initial exploration

- **Going the extra mile (Optional):**

    - Can you create a filter to keep only French respondents?

**:fontawesome-solid-magnifying-glass: Reviewers**

- **5-Minute Brief**

    - Use the "I like, I wish, I wonder" model to give a constructive paper feedback.
    - Identify the **top 3 current risks** in the paper.
    - We always refer to the `main.typ` file.

- **Going the Extra Mile (Optional):**

    - Assist Writers & Hackers with integrating feedback received during class!
