# 30% | Participation

The participation grade is divided into three parts: Live demos, class engagement, and online engagement.

## **:fontawesome-solid-chalkboard-teacher: Live demo**

Students are expected to do a live demo that helps the class understand a topic during a class meeting. A live demo is an hands-on demonstration that introduces a programming, or statistical concept applied to social science and illustrates how to leverage it with coded examples.

- The live demo lasts no longer than 15 minutes.
- **The student presenting has to prepare a handout** that he shares with the group before the class meeting.
