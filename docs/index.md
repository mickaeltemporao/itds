## Overview

This course introduces students to the building blocks of machine learning and artificial intelligence using real world "Big Data" and applications in political science, sociology or economics. The goal is to introduce to methods and tools required to explore and harness the potential of “Big Data”. Learning such methods and tools requires practice. This course follows a “learn-by-doing” approach and will place emphasis on gaining experience by analyzing real-world data and solving problems using cutting edge yet free open source software. It will allow you to apply your theoretical knowledge and articulate the methods learned in an end to end research project throughout the course. The course is designed for social science students that are not necessarily familiar with quantitative methods or computer programming.

### Goals
1. Visualize, summarise, and analyse real-world data using reproducible code based on cutting-edge open source tools for data analysis.
2. Understand the scientific method, critically evaluate existing information, and leverage such methods in a fully reproducible end to end scientific paper.
3. Develop an ethical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of machine learning and artificial intelligence from a social scientist perspective.


### Requirements
The most important requirement is motivation to work hard on likely unfamiliar material. The second most important requirement is to have access to a computer in order to participate and complete the various activities. From there, we will learn as we go!

In order to fight against digital inequalities among students, Sciences Po Bordeaux sets up a support system under certain conditions (presentation of a purchase invoice; N-1 tax notice of your reference tax household ; notification of CROUS scholarship; certificate of attendance for the current year).

For any questions relating to this device and in order to submit your request, please write only to the following address, specifying your needs:

## Structure
This course has 24 class meetings that span over two semester of 12 classes each. During the class meetings students have the opportunity to accomplish various activities. The activities allow students to incrementally assimilate critical concepts that will lead them to deliver a fully reproducible end to end scientific paper.


### Class Meetings
Live class meetings are held once per week and provide students with many opportunities to perform in-class activities related to the material in that week. Each session is divided into three parts: a live demo, the theoretical discussion, and hack-time which demonstrate how to leverage these concepts programmatically.

The demo is lead by a student. A student is expected to do a 15 minutes presentation. This demo is a hands-on demonstration that introduces and applies a programming concept related to the session and illustrates how to use it through an example within the social sciences.

The theoretical discussion is lead by the instructor. The instructor will usually walk through real world examples that supplement the demo to illustrate how to leverage data science in the real world. The students are expected to follow along with their computers.

The hack-time is lead by both the students and the instructor. The instructor will provide code and data that illustrate the application of data science to political science, sociology or economics. This part is often followed by a "challenge" where students will need to apply what they have learned to new data.


### Grading

The course is evaluated over two semesters through various activities allowing students to incrementally improve data science skills. By the end of the course, students will deliver an end to end empirical research paper that is fully reproducible and that leverages the acquired data science skills.

| Activities    | Percentage |
| -             | :-:        |
| Participation | 30%        |
| Challenges    | 30%        |
| Paper         | 40%        |


## Communication

This course has a dedicated communication platform :fontawesome-brands-slack: Slack. When you have questions outside course meetings, click the Communication tab and ask your question in a public channel.

Asking questions publicly and providing answers to your peers' questions allows everyone to learn dynamically. Furthermore, if you have a question on a topic, it is likely that someone else has the same question. Finally, being active on the platform, whether by answering the questions of your peers or by asking questions, is strongly encouraged and will have a positive impact on your participation grade!

Reserve private messages with the instructor for personal matters.
